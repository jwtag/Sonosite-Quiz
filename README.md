# Sonosite-Quiz
My answer to the coding challenge/"quiz" from the Sonosite interviewer.

I decided to do a Java-based approach and use JUnit for the unit testing.

src/Quiz.java - This file contains the methods used to create "youngest_president.txt", "president_longevity.txt", and "histogram.txt".

src/President.java - This is the President object which stores the data for each of the Presidents.

src/Test.java - This file contains the various JUnit tests for testing the methods in my Quiz and President files.

Most of the non-.java files are used in the Unit testing for Quiz.java in Test.java.
