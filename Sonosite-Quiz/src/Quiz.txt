The file input.txt has a comma separated list of first 5 presidents of the United States. 
The data is in format:
<first_name>,<last_name>,<birth_year>,<death_year>,<president_from_date>,<president_to_date>

Write a program or script (Pick a programming/scripting language), that parses input.txt and does the following:

1. Sorts the list by youngest president to join office and outputs youngest_president.txt
2. Sorts the list by the age when they died and outputs president_longevity.txt
3. Find the number of presidents whose names have the letter "a" and "m" appear next to each other and create a histogram of occurrences of "am", and "ma".


What we will be looking for is how you approach the problem, and how you test your solution.
